> GEO = Generative Engine Optimization: getting AI engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, DeepSeek, Doubao…) to **proactively mention and cite your brand** when answering user questions. Not geographic info, not classic SEO.

**Current release:** `0.1.0-rc.2` · `Public Alpha RC` · project Schema `2.0` · `product_stage=public_alpha`.
The canonical distribution version is stored in [`VERSION`](VERSION). Run
`python3 scripts/geo.py version --json` to inspect the same identity used by
the CLI and migration tools.

For a clean release check, install the pinned dependencies and run
`python3 scripts/release_validate.py --output release`. This builds the
offline Tester Kit, runs its smoke test, starts the real source UI briefly,
runs `delivery-doctor`, scans the artifact, and writes SHA-256, manifest,
release notes, and sanitized test logs. See
[`RELEASE_ARTIFACTS.md`](RELEASE_ARTIFACTS.md).

## 1. Problems it solves

More and more users ask AI directly — "best tools for X", "X vs Y, which one". If your brand:

| Problem | What the Agent gives you |
|---|---|
| **AI never mentions you** — you're not in the candidate set for category questions | Samples real answers engine by engine; quantifies mention rate / rank / citation share; diagnoses "absent" vs "competitor-dominated" |
| **You don't know why** — AI is a black box | 6-dimension site audit + gap diagnosis: uncrawlable pages? missing extraction blocks? absent from the channels AI actually cites? inconsistent messaging? |
| **Advice never lands** — recommendations pile up, nobody executes or verifies | Generates implementation tickets with acceptance criteria; 86% auto-verifiable in the sample project (18/21) — "done" is measured, not claimed |
| **Did the work even help?** | Per-question before/after across sampling rounds + task-level before/after |
| **You deliver GEO as a service and packaging is painful** | One click produces diagnosis report, strategy, execution plan, ticket CSV, and acceptance sheet for clients |

## 2. Feature map

Four stages plus operations, all in one self-hosted dashboard:

**Status** — Engine performance across 15 engines (10 automated via API + 5 manual sheets): mention rate, rank, citation share, what each engine actually cites, **sample replay** of raw answers, suspected-negative flags; **brand mention distribution** (you vs. competitors, per engine and aggregated); competitor tables with each rival's strongest engine one click away; a 7-category question bank where every question gets a **diagnosis type** (suspected-negative > competitor-dominated > absent > low-ranked).

**Keyword mining** — expand the question bank from real search demand: Baidu suggest (CN) + Google autocomplete (Global) terms from brand/competitor/category roots (free public endpoints, no keys). Each round is snapshot-diffed to flag **rising demand** (affects topic ordering, never metrics); alternative/vs phrasings mined from competitor roots feed the Competitors page. Candidates only — adding to the bank is always a manual check.

![Engines](docs/screenshots-en/engines.png)

**Diagnosis** — Site audit (robots / sitemap / llms.txt / accessibility / language coverage / extraction blocks, with click-through filtering straight to the fixing ticket); gap diagnosis (content → channels → facts); a **channel map of 19 channels** weighted by real citation-corpus data, each specifying what to build, how much, at what cadence, by whom; a **brand facts library** as the single source of truth that llms.txt, JSON-LD and content drafts are generated from.

![Channel map](docs/screenshots-en/channels.png)

**Action** — Structured tickets (rationale / owner / effort / window / acceptance criteria) with "first-measured → current → target" progress bars and automatic reopening on regressions; a **content workbench** (topic pool sorted by "not mentioned + no content", required extraction blocks and brand facts at hand, live citability pre-check, fabrication-risk lint for AI drafts, and a **distribution checklist** matching each piece to its target channels); **deploy assets** (llms.txt, JSON-LD, HTML snippets, each labeled with its destination, plus a DEPLOY.md runbook); **publishing** to GitHub / WordPress drafts / WeChat OA drafts / webhook — always manually confirmed.

![Action plan](docs/screenshots-en/plan.png)
![Workbench](docs/screenshots-en/workbench.png)

**Results** — Per-question before/after (all / CN / global tabs), task-level before/after, verification history; boss-ready one-pager, execution plan, and a complete client delivery package (HTML + CSV).

**Operations** — Scheduled full-cycle re-runs (every 7/14/30 days), multi-brand with one-click switching, and a manual-sampling loop (export sheet → fill → re-import) that feeds the same metrics.

## 3. How it differs from other GEO tools

Most GEO products are **monitoring SaaS**: they show mention rates and rankings, charge monthly, and keep your data in their cloud. This project is an **implementation platform**:

| | Typical GEO monitoring SaaS | GEO Delivery Ops Agent |
|---|---|---|
| **Loop depth** | Monitor + advise | Monitor → diagnose → **tickets → assets → auto-verify → deliver** |
| **Verification** | None (or manual check-off) | Programmatic: re-crawl + next sampling round decide; regressions reopen automatically |
| **Metrics** | Black-box scores | Fully reproducible; a "where do these numbers come from" panel in the UI; unmeasured shows "unmeasured", never faked |
| **Chinese market** | Mostly Western engines | First-class CN engine matrix (GLM / Doubao / DeepSeek / Kimi / MiniMax / Nano / Baidu AI) + CN channels calibrated on citation-corpus data (Baike, ranking sites, WeChat, Toutiao…); CN and Global measured separately |
| **Scoring basis** | Heuristics | Anchored in public empirical data: 602 prompts / 21,143 citations / 187,818 deduplicated CN citations ([references/](references/)) |
| **Data ownership** | Vendor cloud | **Everything on your machine** under `work/` (JSON/Markdown); `git init` is your backup |
| **Cost** | Subscription | Free and open source; you only pay your own engine API sampling costs (can be zero — manual sampling works) |
| **Deliverables** | Dashboard screenshots | Client-ready diagnosis report / strategy / execution plan / ticket CSV — built for agencies and consultants |

Honest limits: single-machine tool, no accounts or team collaboration; sampling frequency and volume depend on your own API budget; "suspected negative" flags are leads for human review, not verdicts. These are deliberate design choices.

## 4. Deployment

### Requirements

- macOS or Linux (Windows via WSL — the code uses `fcntl` file locks)
- Python **3.9+**
- Exactly three third-party packages: `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `lxml`

### Three steps

```bash
# 1. From this complete merged source repository
cd geo-delivery-ops-runtime
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Start the dashboard (opens your browser)
python3 scripts/geo.py ui        # → http://127.0.0.1:8765

# 3. (Optional) Configure engine API keys
#    A: in the dashboard — Settings → Engines & Keys → "Configure" (writes local .env)
#    B: cp .env.example .env and edit
```

This repository contains the complete runnable local source for the Delivery Ops
Agent. Compatibility records, applied Change Sets, host-file modifications, and
license attribution are recorded in [UPSTREAM.md](UPSTREAM.md). The offline
Tester Kit is a separate artifact; it does not contain the full runtime files.

**Zero keys works too**: automated sampling is skipped; use the manual sampling sheet loop instead. Crawling, auditing, tickets and assets need no keys. One CN-capable key (e.g. DeepSeek/GLM) unlocks auto-derivation of the question bank / brand facts and AI first drafts.

### Remote / server deployment

The server binds to `127.0.0.1` only (a deliberate security boundary — there is no auth layer). For remote access:

```bash
ssh -N -L 8765:127.0.0.1:8765 user@your-server   # then open http://127.0.0.1:8765 locally
```

For multi-user setups put a reverse proxy with auth in front. `.env` and `work/` contain secrets and project data — mind file permissions.

### Upgrading

```bash
git pull        # your data lives in work/ and .env, both gitignored
```

## 5. Usage

### Route A: fully automated (10–30 min)

```bash
python3 scripts/geo.py new --url https://example.com --market both
```

`--market` is `cn` / `global` / `both`. Nine steps run automatically: crawl → audit → derive facts/competitors/questions → sample every engine → tickets → assets → report → auto-verify → delivery package, landing in `work/<slug>/delivery/<date>/`.

### Route B: dashboard walkthrough (recommended first time)

1. **Onboard** — `python3 scripts/geo.py ui`, follow the 3-step wizard (URL + market), hit "create & auto-bootstrap". The first cycle runs in the background.
2. **Review the foundation** (important, ~10 min) — facts are extracted only from your site copy; unknowns are marked "unconfirmed". Check **Brand Facts** (fix wording, add aliases — missing aliases understate mention rate) and the **Question Bank** (do questions read like real user queries?).
3. **Status** — Overview for the one-line verdict and health score; **Engines** to drill into each engine and replay raw answers (log factual errors on the spot); **Competitors** to see each rival's strongest engine — that's the channel to go build.
4. **Diagnosis** — Site audit (click a missing block → its fixing ticket) → Gap diagnosis → Channel map (open any channel for its build plan).
5. **Execute** — Take tickets P0-first in **Action Plan** (click a title for why/how/acceptance); write in the **Workbench** (pre-check ≥ B, publish as final, then work through the distribution checklist); deploy **Assets** (llms.txt to site root, JSON-LD into `<head>`, snippets into templates — see DEPLOY.md).
6. **Verify** — Settings → "Auto-verify" re-crawls and judges tickets; after the next sampling round, check per-question before/after in **Verification**.
7. **Operate** — enable scheduled re-runs (7/14/30 days); generate monthly reports and client packages in **Reports & Delivery**.

### Manual sampling for engines without APIs

```bash
python3 scripts/geo.py sample-sheet  --slug <project>   # export sheet with per-question guidance
python3 scripts/geo.py sample-import --slug <project> --file <sheet>
```

### CLI cheat sheet

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `new` / `serve` / `cycle` | Automated new project / full cycle / light loop |
| `ui` | Full-workflow dashboard |
| `bootstrap` / `crawl` / `audit` | Derive foundation / crawl / 6-dimension scoring |
| `sample` / `sample-sheet` / `sample-import` | API sampling / manual sheets |
| `plan` / `generate` / `lint` | Tickets / assets (`--draft` adds drafts) / fabrication-risk check |
| `verify` / `report` / `deliverables` / `deliver` | Auto-verify / reports / formal deliverables / client package |
| `publish` / `task` / `status` / `list` | Publish content / ticket status / project board / projects |

Every command has `--help`.

## FAQ

**Q: AI answers differ every time — how can sampling results be stable?**

A single AI answer is inherently stochastic, so the Agent **never reads a single answer** as a metric. Stability comes from four layers:

1. **Aggregation** — mention rate and friends are ratios over dozens of questions × multiple engines; per-question jitter averages out.
2. **Fixed variables** — each engine's sampling model is pinned (visible and changeable in Settings), the question bank is fixed, and the same set is reused across rounds; the only thing that changes is time.
3. **Repeat rounds** — `sample --repeat N` samples each question multiple times when your budget allows.
4. **Attribution discipline** — the UI explicitly labels single-round movement as observational ("a drop isn't necessarily a regression — sampling is noisy"); only two consecutive rounds moving the same way count as a trend, and ticket verification relies on deterministic signals (re-crawling the site) rather than sampling alone.

Honestly put: it measures a **distribution**, not a fixed value — which is exactly what real users experience, since every real query to an AI engine draws a random sample too.

## Evidence-based scoring

All six audit dimensions are anchored in public empirical data; `scripts/audit.py` implements [references/method.md](references/method.md):

- High-impact pages average **1,943 words**; low scorers just 170 (11.4×)
- Numbers **+61.6%**, definitions **+57.3%**, comparisons **+55.3%**, how-to **+41.2%** citation-probability lift
- Pure Q&A formatting is **−5.7%** — looking like an FAQ doesn't help
- Topical relevance is the strongest predictor (r = 0.432), above authority
- Brand-owned sites get only **1.37%** of CN citations — your site is the fact source; external channels are the citation sources

## Design principles & security boundaries

- **Single-machine, self-hosted**: stdlib `http.server` on 127.0.0.1; no DB, no accounts; data is plain files
- **Never fabricate**: facts only from site copy; inventing competitor names is forbidden; AI drafts must pass lint + human review
- **Verification is the product**: anything auto-verifiable never relies on someone saying "done"
- **Publishing is always manual**: channel credentials in local `.env` (mode 600); every publish is an explicit click; WeChat/WordPress go to drafts only

## Claude Code integration (optional)

This repo doubles as a Claude Code skill ([SKILL.md](SKILL.md)): drop it into your skills directory and tell Claude "do GEO for example.com". Claude is optional — every script is a plain CLI.

## GEO Delivery Ops Agent overlay

This checkout includes the local-only Delivery Ops workflow for 10–200 person
global SaaS, AI, and smart-hardware teams. It uses plain files and adds a
seven-stage evidence chain: baseline → diagnosed → scoped → assigned → asset_ready →
deployed → verified. Asset generation alone never closes a ticket.

- [Methodology](docs/delivery-ops/methodology.md)
- [Operations](docs/delivery-ops/operations.md)
- [Public Alpha release boundary](docs/delivery-ops/release-boundary.md)
- Offline fictional examples: [SaaS](examples/saas-ai-support) and
  [smart hardware](examples/smart-hardware)
- [MIT attribution and derivative-work notice](NOTICE.md)
- [Public Alpha release checklist](PUBLIC_ALPHA_RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md),
  [known limitations](KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md), and [validation log](VALIDATION_LOG.md)
- [Industry template method](docs/delivery-ops/INDUSTRY_TEMPLATE_METHOD.md) and fictional
  candidate packs for [SaaS](examples/industry-template-packs/saas),
  [AI Product](examples/industry-template-packs/ai-product), and
  [Smart Hardware](examples/industry-template-packs/smart-hardware)
- [Business priority method](references/priority-method.md) and its
  [machine-readable schema](references/priority-schema.json)

The examples use reserved `.invalid` domains and are read-only snapshots. Do not crawl,
deploy, or verify them as real projects. This extension does not promise AI rankings,
mentions, citations, traffic, leads, or opportunities.

Before releasing or delivering a project, run the read-only doctor. Any `FAIL` returns
exit code 1 and blocks release; `--json` produces a machine-readable result.

```bash
python3 scripts/geo.py delivery-doctor --slug <slug>
```

The Phase 8 templates support English websites only. They add candidate questions,
diagnosis mappings, asset choices, approval roles, and acceptance checks under
`delivery.industry_template*`; they never create evidence, approve work, or advance a
task's delivery stage.

Phase 9 adds deterministic 0–3 business-priority dimensions and cycle-capacity
recommendations. These recommendations are advisory: they never write a scope decision,
approve facts, or reject work on behalf of the Project Owner.

Phase 10 adds explicit CSV imports for GA4, Google Search Console, CRM, website forms,
sales notes, and sales-reported AI discovery. Signals are stored locally in
`business_signals.jsonl`, mapped to a task only when a landing page or deployment URL
matches uniquely, and shown as observational evidence. This layer never performs revenue
attribution or claims that GEO caused a conversion. See
[business signal method](references/business-signal-method.md) and
[business signal schema](references/business-signal-schema.json).

Phase 11 adds one-way execution exports and optional external adapters. CSV, Markdown,
JSON and GitHub Issue copies can be imported into existing tools; explicit GitHub Issue
creation and redacted Webhooks write only `external_refs`. External state never closes or
changes an internal task. See [INTEGRATIONS.md](INTEGRATIONS.md).
